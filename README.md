## 1.0 API's, Descriptions and Functionality

API stands for Application programming interface and is one of the most used tools when programmers want to build any application or program a solution for a problem. API's come with an almost incomprehensible amount of variation and each one suited to deal with certain tasks that the programmer would otherwise need to do themselves. As well as this each one will have functions that help a programmer create whatever the API is more suited to help build. 

For example, Visual studio is a very commonly used API, this API allows programmers to access an in-built debugger as well as providing syntax colouring to the programmers that use it. Because it can offer these different functionalities to the user, it is much more commonly used in comparison to API’s such as Notepad and Notepad++ which do not offer as much help to the programmers as other API’s despite accomplishing the same task in the end. Despite this, Notepad++ is still much more reliable and can make programming much easier than doing it on a console instead.

The actual definition of an API is still very debatable among the programming community and often many different programmers will debate and disagree with others theory on what API’s are. However, the most commonly accepted is that an API allows the uses of certain procedures and certain functions to allow the creation of an application or other form of creation. In short, it is an application that allows other applications to be created.



### 1.1 SDK's

Where API's provide an interface that helps offer 'some' functionality towards an application or project being completed, there is another tool that programmers use in order to help with programming different projects. They use what is called an SDK, this stands for a Software Development Kit and instead of it being one tool with a few different functionalities for programming, an SDK is a set of tools that are set to benefit a single purpose. 

SDK’s are a set of tools or classes that can allow a programmer to fulfil a very specific task or add a specific functionality towards the game. By adding in these functionalities, it can allow a programmer to access different components within them, allowing for even more functionality within their program. This means that by using a SDK, a programmer can find easier or less complicated ways for a system to complete and fulfil a certain function that is given to it. 


### 1.2 Relationship between API's and SDK's

Because of the different ways that SDK’s and API’s work, many people that first understand what they are believe that they are separate, however API’s and SDK’s can work closely in conjunction with each other. The API can provide the interface and some tools to help basic programming, then SDK’s can help with the specific functionalities of the program. Because of this both are seen used together to maximise functionality within a program.

API’s and SDK’s are often used closely together due their functionality being able to help the other complete their tasks easier. SDK’s are not useless on their own however, many systems are built and rely on the functions that SDK have. For example, the ‘IOS’, IOS is the operating system that Apple use for their hardware and with this system apple integrated the ‘IOS SDK’, this is the IOS Software Development Kit and provides a lot of the functionality within the operating system. 

The SDK in IOS allows for many functions that will be more beneficial for customer use and more for customer satisfaction such as ‘Audio Recording’, ‘Video Playback’ whilst allowing more technical functions such as security and allowing threads to be used within the processing of the system functions. By utilising all of these and adding their functionality into the system, the functionality and overall quality of the system increases, this SDK is one of the examples of where the tools and components have allowed an operating system to increase in functionality.

When looking at the relationship between API’s and SDK’s, the main thing to remember is how they interact with each other. Since a SDK is a set of tools and components that can allow programmers to access more functions, it is quite common for the SDK to actually contain an API within them. Having API’s within them means that some API’s belong to SDK’s, but remember that an SDK cannot be part of an API, it is only the other way around.

SDK's are built from a series of API's this is because...


### 1.3 Assessment of API's for a range of uses

When using an API, the type of API used all depends on the kind of task that you want it to perform, API's have a massive range of functionality thanks to how many there are, if a developer needs to build an application which uses functions to tell what the weather is, then the developer may use an API such as 'Dark Sky API', this API allows the user to access forecasts, data on past events, weather alerts and much more by integrating the API within the program. As well as this, the developer could also choose to use the 'Openweathermap', once again this API can allow the developer to add all the functionality that they would need to create a successful program which has functions for either showing the current conditions of the weather, to showing when their is an alert, this is why API's are used throughout development and programming.

Whilst building a weather program with the API is impressive, the uses of API's go much further than that, another example of using API's to benefit programming is using a program for social media such as Instagram or Facebook, these types of programs can be used for enhanced profile searching, database checking and reviewing or just real time updating on websites and many more. In order to make this easier for the developer, they can use API's such as 'Instagram's API' which would allow the developer to have notifications for posts uploaded to their site in real time for multiple accounts at once. As well as this the developer may choose to use the 'Parse' API, this is an API utilised by Facebook in order to push notifications, allow functions for user authentication and other benefits such as File storage. Having these types of API's integrated within a program can allow for the program to successfully complete all the tasks assigned to it, all while adding user experience to the program allowing it to be easier to access and safer as well.

Having API's for almost all uses and ranges, one of the more commercial uses is for marketing and commonly Stock trading, API's allow for real time updates on the latests changes events and availabilty of products

Most of the time API's are built for set functions, for example when looking at 'Dark Sky API' it is built for adding weather functionality to a program 



## 1.4 Functionality of API's

The limit to API's is almost endless and each API has a large multitude of functions that can help for any form of task, that is why API's are so popular.

### 1.5 Designing and extending using API's 

API's are commonly used to help design applications, this is because of how much functionality they can add towards the development of an application or software by making the project easier to develop. As well as offer tools to help develop software, it can also be used to extend a product in order to add functionality to it whilst also allowing it to keep the fundamentals of what made the software. Having this option to add functions to a software means that people are able to keep it fresh and make it more enticing by having more uses out of one software.

Extending a software can be done for many different reasons ranging from
