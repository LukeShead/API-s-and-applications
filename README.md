# Programming API's, SDK's and all between.


## 1.0 API's, what are they and what do they do?

API stands for Application programming interface and is one of the most used tools when programmers want to build any application or program a solution for a problem. API's come with an almost incomprehensible amount of variation and each one suited to deal with certain tasks that the programmer would otherwise need to do themselves. As well as this each one will have functions that help a programmer create whatever the API is more suited to help build. 

For example, Visual studio is a very commonly used API, this API allows programmers to access an in-built debugger as well as providing syntax colouring to the programmers that use it. Because it can offer these different functionalities to the user, it is much more commonly used in comparison to API’s such as Notepad and Notepad++ which do not offer as much help to the programmers as other API’s despite accomplishing the same task in the end.

The actual definition of an API is still very debatable among the programming community and often many different programmers will debate and disagree with others theory on what API’s are. However, the most commonly accepted is that an API allows the uses of certain procedures and certain functions to allow the creation of an application or other form of creation. In short, it is an application that allows other applications to be created.

### 1.1 SDK's

Where API's provide an interface that helps offer 'some' functionality towards an application or project being completed, there is another tool that programmers use in order to help with programming different projects. They use what is called an SDK, this stands for a Software Development Kit and instead of it being one tool with a few different functionalities for programming, an SDK is a set of tools that are set to benefit a single purpose. 

SDK’s are a set of tools or classes that can allow a programmer to fulfil a very specific task or add a specific functionality towards the game. By adding in these functionalities, it can allow a programmer to access different components within them, allowing for even more functionality within their program. This means that by using a SDK, a programmer can find easier or less complicated ways for a system to complete and fulfil a certain function that is given to it. 


### 1.2 Intergrating API's and SDK's

Because of the different ways that SDK’s and API’s work, many people that first understand what they are believe that they are separate, however API’s and SDK’s can work closely in conjunction with each other. The API can provide the interface and some tools to help basic programming, then SDK’s can help with the specific functionalities of the program. Because of this both are seen used together to maximise functionality within a program.

API’s and SDK’s are often used closely together due their functionality being able to help the other complete their tasks easier. SDK’s are not useless on their own however, many systems are built and rely on the functions that SDK have. For example, the ‘IOS’, IOS is the operating system that Apple use for their hardware and with this system apple integrated the ‘IOS SDK’, this is the IOS Software Development Kit and provides a lot of the functionality within the operating system. 

The SDK in IOS allows for many functions that will be more beneficial for customer use and more for customer satisfaction such as ‘Audio Recording’, ‘Video Playback’ whilst allowing more technical functions such as security and allowing threads to be used within the processing of the system functions. By utilising all of these and adding their functionality into the system, the functionality and overall quality of the system increases, this SDK is one of the examples of where the tools and components have allowed an operating system to increase in functionality.
